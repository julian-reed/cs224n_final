Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
That am well turned mad by pleasant memories done;
The wrinkles I both see, and others far worse.
For with mind life sometimes that man's beauty hangs,
That need I no sensual adornage to severest
Shifts hither in green, to be attended with red light,
To some though thick green gray which does sustain him all.
All that life I see deals me joyless grief;
But to my painful grief content I bliss live;
  And live upon thy woe, dear friend, I never see thee dead.

Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me.
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
When my smile returns, sweet lips conforming,
Making me an opium witglass while mine eyes pierce round his bald neck;
What guardes can I need at his word
To guard from thine own unclean hand the painful loss
Of love and friend?
Which soft stroke lieth in those heartbeats,
Even so mine own heart is cruel to behold
The tears, and their deep, well-worn, like as honey is
From what lover doth prostrate in mine foe's belly;
  Or draws me back, if you don't.
  Love, stranger than this

So, now I have confessed that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine may look upon
The debtor himself to pay me back;
For that's why the amount paid is so high,
And so high is this which is in my heart.
"Who buyth my defense so low? for these do me crave,
Because thou dost give them thine own salt
Like beasts of prey, large enough to cleave
To kill any man that dost look upon them
And this thine is without defense,
And needs no army but thine own sweet would win.
  Then pardon, then make fast; mine may his loss not prove
  Even such loss is

Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
And will to boot, and will in overplus.
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
Will I weary thee thy every doubt,
And wail thee by occasion of need so doubtful;
As if I with intent spake my fear
And punted thee to flattery of faces diminished.
But shall thy oath surekill thee thenceforth,
Or shall backstab me amiss,
And worse be found, for love hindst thou so much that thou shan't reconcile;
Till there she hasn't hanged a fickle sentence,
Or hanged offenses: there had been slain a thief;
  For love [that love] must die, thee wrong judgment show.

If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Twice—yes, twice—I see thee now
As a king of thy beauty's castle, charging all day with speed
That wreathing it down with into his room,
Pending stromat[169] change when used do he rush;
So show me your monument when my throne becomes empty,
Thy virtue it lieth immaculate.
Be you lover in my content, let my neck slide
And cease, when I may state how thou moved me that evening.
  Why love, thou wilt think much my trespass:
  It matters not whether I be stripped or

Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
Hath it make-believe, but not in their own sight,
While thou unseen decease;
And if they consider thee quite foolish,
Their reply shall be restatured by error.
No man in thy seeing can make any stroke more easy
Than Thou art, because their view is perfectly right;
And yet so sweet hare they play thee it schemeth
To make thee wretched them by breeding them according to thy love.
  They are children of love, and youth they have doth boast
  Of beautiful leaf, especially thereof.

When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
And some revelry of astrology says she hath shown
The very highest form of virtue;
And yet, so far as all my geists know,
My heart's praise hearest through my throat;
And so far then has my love I scorned her
Through earthly education alone
And, certain lackeys of wealth, fain'ring being wise in haughty stage;
And I if it be doubted, on account of that I live
Thy virtue has no authority under body's weight
Where thy thought extends far with my cheerfulness.
  By thee this die I derive
 


7
O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
For thoughts which I abhor, though love one,
That do offend thee in my heart many faults,
And my reproach no burden, dull in mind.
"These idiotic reflections," said I to myself,
"do condemn me not to believe them if they deceive thee,"
So I did see if the eyes were fair,
Making an estimation for me how all evil shows;
All briers, all grace me well,
Which for their worth begetting no respect,
Except my inward self, that mourneth so
  That the cedar shall bark decay by decay.


8
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express much sorrow
Thy own bereavement to thee.
The winds were running faster and harder on thee,
It hath not yet removed dully the farce in thee
The greatest connexion and frolic not on himself
Which all full wickedness oft doth swerve,
Disassembling us all into the strait of thy day,
Bearing small woe upon my loving brother.
O, whom none so much opinion disputes
That I think thy right afore mentioned fat, fine, ageless, partaking of works,
Almost all deserts to them Which are none too great;
  They

In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
And my heart that quotes them forth with their suggestions;
So they, doubting whether they were in thee,
Worshiped and mistreated alike,
Yet this is sufficient reason to keep me from thee.
" So shall the sun's mercy dish I desire
Even in thee formless strife,
Thy greatest treasure a man does burn that rightfully hates,
Making remembrances of useful customs by thee.
 " Oh my sweet love, you rich churl thought,
After that which thou so rich as mine eye and tongue knows.
  See, they see, thy heavenly treasure leads thee from

Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
To what other sins belong?
Having neglected thyself the question,
I do offer help, as though I were new,
While self-justed love works in thee,
To fill thy being unjustly mistaken.
Now thou, being new in thyself thy part,
Stain strong again being free,
Wherein love's later retreat shall stave off long stood enemy.
  What strength can praise these mercy-loan-refused disasters
  Shall battle deny, though not lose battle.

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
With ready mirth; the devoted hounds buffet
And carry-aways both aid and fling quickly;
Ere the wandering trail is reopened,
The man makes haste return, keeping free the leg.
In god's duty horses are seen
Of pure gallantry and sober fight, but in fairs they lean
For capricious gallants feeding un well-ordered gallants
From milk whelmed with harmful demon horse.
  And the sweaters the god gave
  Shall only garment the scar on thee:
  But fairs neither walk nor play men's apparel.
